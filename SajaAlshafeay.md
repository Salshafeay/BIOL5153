 **PERSONAL STATEMENT**

I am a motivated, capable, and detail-oriented biological researcher focused on the development, synthesis, and modification of biocompatible materials for biological applications, cell organelles targeting, and lab management. I am an expert in lab maintenance, research and data collection, and am comfortable working in a chemical and biological labs environment. I enjoy both working in the lab and teaching and advising students.
